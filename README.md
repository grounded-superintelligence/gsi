## setup

Grounded requires Python 3.10 or newer. Install it from a source checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install .
# or
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/grounded-superintelligence/grounded.git
```

## usage

A delivery includes a JSON manifest plus access to the exact files it
references. No API server is required.

The quickest validation uses the existing Python demo:

```bash
python demo.py --manifest /path/to/manifest.json --episode 0
```

Both commands download every available enrichment lane, report unavailable or
partial lanes, and write an MP4 (camera grid with hand skeletons) and a Rerun
`.rrd` file (world-frame when the SLAM lane is available) under `outputs/`.
Downloads are cached under `~/.cache/grounded/data`.

Numeric episode indexes follow the row order in the supplied manifest.

If a legacy manifest does not include SHA-256 checksums, add
`--allow-missing-sha256`. New manifests should include checksums.

### manifest access

The SDK supports two delivery options:

- A manifest containing presigned HTTPS URLs works without AWS credentials.
  The URLs stop working at their stated expiration time.
- A manifest containing `s3://` URIs uses the normal AWS credential chain.
  Pass `--aws-profile PROFILE` to the demo when using a named local profile.

Credentials are never stored in the manifest or packaged in the SDK.

The same flow can be used directly from Python:

```python
# see demo.py for reference
from grounded.data.processing import ProcessingClient
from grounded.data.visualize_hand import visualize_hand_episode_to_mp4

client = ProcessingClient.from_manifest("manifest.json")
record = client.list_episodes()[0]

episode = client.open_hand(record.episode_id, active_cameras=["left_front"])
try:
    visualize_hand_episode_to_mp4(
        episode,
        "episode.mp4",
        caption=episode.caption,
    )
finally:
    episode.close()
```

See [`docs/ASSET_EPISODE_FLOW.md`](docs/ASSET_EPISODE_FLOW.md) for the complete
asset and episode control flow, and [`docs/DATA.md`](docs/DATA.md) for the
exact specification of every array the readers expose.

Deliveries that add synchronized camera views without changing episode bounds
can publish an additive view revision. See
[`docs/EPISODE_VIEW_REVISIONS.md`](docs/EPISODE_VIEW_REVISIONS.md).
